# Code Quiz

## What is the purpose of this project? 

This is an online quiz with multiple-choice questions related to coding. This application will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## How to achieve my goal?

I created html and css files to build the look of the quiz while inputting different questions dynamically via the script file. Within the script file, I sorted the questions and answers into arrays with correct answers. I mainly used jQuery to run functions, including hide/reveal different div elements, and to call out different functions. 

## Challenges

It was not easy to sort out the logic in each function that is necessary to pull in the correction questions, storing the answers, and determining the correctness of the user's input. Oftentimes the codes wouldn't run properly with my first attempt.
